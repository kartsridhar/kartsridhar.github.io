  text: Apart from academics, I enjoy playing all kind of sports. I particularly like
        football and table tennis. Back in the day, I represented my high school for various
        inter-school tournaments. As a practice, I regularly take part in the University's respective club
        activities.

        On the other hand, I have always believed in giving back to the society and
        take part in various volunteering and poverty alleviation campaigns.
