I am a third year Computer Scientist at the University of Bristol and will be graduating with a Masters in 2021. I like learning new tools and my interests particularly lie in Data Analytics. I am eager to use my understanding to develop data dependent tools and am already in the works of doing so. I have also been learning about UI/UX recently.

In my past life, I represented my school table tennis team at various levels, leading the team to a victory in one of them. I also enjoy playing and watching football.
