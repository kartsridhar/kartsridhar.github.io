To experiment with _Item Based Collaborative Filtering_, I wrote a python script that finds similar movies and recommendations through correlation. For testing purposes, I used the dataset provided by [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/).

If the user runs the program and enters the movie name per the format, the program uses vital information such as **genre** and **Movie Ratings** to return a list of similar movies. For recommendations, the program does the same process and uses the **number** of unique user ratings and information from corresponding covariance matrices to recommend a list of movies.

For instance, when the **similar.py** script is run:

```
$ python similar.py
Enter a movie of the form MOVIE_NAME (YEAR_OF_RELEASE): Fight Club (1999)
```

An output (image above) is returned.
