As part of the Concurrent Computing coursework, I developed a kernel for Cortex-A8 (above) emulated by [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/). The skeleton was provided by the University
Most of it is written in C and Assembly. The core stuff of the kernel can be found in [hilevel.c](https://github.com/kartsridhar/Kernel-Cortex-A8/blob/master/question/kernel/hilevel.c).

### Features of the Kernel
* Dynamic creation and termination of user programs. For example: P3, P4, P5 and 2B
* Priority-based scheduling of the PCBs. I do not use any data structure here however have made a linked-list library for it [here](https://github.com/kartsridhar/Linked-List-Library/blob/master/list.c).
* Inter Process Communication (Message Passing/Pipes) demonstrated by a program that solves the [Dining Philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).

All source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/kartsridhar/Kernel-Cortex-A8).
