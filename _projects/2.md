As the University of Bristol launched the **Global Transfer Programme** to enable students studying at selected overseas university partners to transfer onto specific programmes, the Bristol Buddies scheme was launched. The idea was to match transfer students with current students (their “Buddy”) who would volunteer their time to provide regular peer support and act as a reliable point of contact to help with the integration of transfer students.

To facilitate this process, we created an Android application that helps connect incoming transfer students with their matched buddy. The application provided a platform to connect students with their buddies and a messaging service for communication. The buddies were matched to the students on the basis of common matches in personality traits, motivations and expectations.

The application was developed utilising the MIT license.
