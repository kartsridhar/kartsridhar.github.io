To experiment with classification, I wrote a program that classifies text as _Spam_ or _Ham_ (Not Spam).
I used [sklearn's](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) classification library for the same. For easier, faster and accurate predictions, I built the training model using [Multinomial Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html).

The dataset used to train this model can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

Through Flask, I _turned_ the Python application into a Web Interface (above). Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, I deployed the Flask application onto cloud. Below is the output for the above text entered.
