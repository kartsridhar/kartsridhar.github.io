As part of the Concurrent Computing coursework, as pairs, we implemented the classic zero player cellular automation game, [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in XC, a langauge that supports parallel programming. We used XMOS' [xCore 200](https://www.xmos.com/products/general/kits#explorerkit) explorer kit to achieve the same.

We implemented a Message Passing model between the channels and were successfully able to run automations for images upto 300 by 300 pixels.
